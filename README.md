# Recipe-App
The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It will allow you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow you to make them public so anyone can access them.

## Project requirements
- You should follow the layout of the wireframes provided. You should personalize the rest of the design including colors, typographies, spacings, etc.
- Login page and registration page:
    - Should be built with Devise.
- Food list:
    - Should display a list of food as in the wireframe.
    - Should lead to the form that allows users to add new food.
- Recipies list:
    - Should display a list of recipes created by the logged-in user as in the wireframe.
    - Should lead to recipe details.
    - If the user is the owner of the recipe, should allow user to delete it.
- Public recipe list:
    - Should display a list of all public recipes ordered by newest as in the wireframe.
    - Should lead to recipe details.
- Recipe details:
    - If the recipe is public or the user is the owner of the recipe, should display the recipe details as in the wireframe.
    - If the user is the owner of the recipe, should lead to the form that allows user to add new food.
- General shopping list view (**do not implement if in group of 3**):
    - Should show the list of food that is missing for all recipes of the logged-in user.
